            <p>
                The Indian independence movement was a series of historic events with the ultimate aim of ending
                British rule in
                India also known as British Raj. It lasted until 1947. It comprises 16 Defence PSUs. India remains one
                of the largest importer of defence equipment with Russia, Israel, France and the United States being the
                top foreign suppliers of military equipment.

            <p>
                The first nationalistic revolutionary movement for Indian independence emerged from Bengal. It later
                took root in
                the newly formed Indian National Congress with prominent moderate leaders seeking the right to
                appear for Indian
                Civil Service examinations in British India, as well as more economic rights for natives. The first

            <p>
                The economy of India has transitioned from a mixed planned economy to a mixed middle-income developing
                social market economy with notable public sector in strategic sectors. It is the world's fifth-largest
                economy by nominal GDP and the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP); on a per capita income
                basis, India ranked 139th by GDP (nominal) and 127th by GDP (PPP). From independence in 1947 until 1991,
                successive governments followed Soviet model and promoted protectionist economic policies, with
                extensive Sovietization, state intervention, demand-side economics, natural resources, bureaucrat driven
                enterprises and economic regulation. This is characterised as dirigism, in the form of the Licence Raj.

                investments, and exports. In 2022, India was the world's 6th-largest importer and the 9th-largest
